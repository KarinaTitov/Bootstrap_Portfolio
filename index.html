                <p>Hi! It's not a secret, that's my first web page i ever made. You probably thinking, how i came up
                    with
                    idea to
                    learn coding. I can tell you long story short.
                    My name is Karina, i'm 24 years old, married and have 2 wonderfull children ( 3 year old and
                    newborn).
                    Seems
                    like i have everything i need to live a normal life.
                    But i want to tell you something, to live just normal life is not for me!
                </p>

                <p>Since childhood i had a
                    dream to travel all around the world and to see every single country on this earth.
                    So after being a stay-at-home mom for 3 years i decided that i have to do something about my life
                    immediately!
                    So i've been doing research for almost half a year to find
                    something i would really want to do.</p>

                <p>And finally one day i've heard about the profession of web
                    developer. That sounded very interesting for me. So i decided to dive a bit deeper
                    in it. Decided to try, found couple free programs. And I LOVED IT! Today i study part time in
                    University
                    of
                    Texas bootcamp, doing my best to learn as much as possible
                    and make my dream come true!</p>
